Problem:
Predict the survival of passengers in Titanic disaster.


Approach to problem:
1. A supervised learning problem. Since the dependent variable(Survived) has two classes(yes/no), I have used Logistic Regression.
2. Feature engineering(extracting more information from the raw data and creating new variables).
3. Handling missing values for the variables.
4. Univariate analysis.
5. Transforming variables as per the assumptions of logistic regression.
6. Dividing the dataset into training and test dataset.
7. Building the model.
8. Prediction and validating the model.

Description of the files:
1) train.csv: This file contains the data to train the model.
2)test.csv: This contains the data for validating the model
3)titanic.R: This file contains series of steps(along with the code) I have followed in building the model.
